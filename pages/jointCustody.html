								<h2>About the Game</h2>
								<p><b>Joint Custody</b> was a project made with some friends for a game jam during the start of our third year of university. In it you play as two children fighting it out in court to decide who gets to go home with the better parent. First to three knockouts wins the game!</p>
								<p>The game was developed over the course of <b>two weeks</b>, initially the plan was to continue this game as our final year project, however in the end we decided to create a new project (Buggin' Out) instead, leaving this project slightly undeveloped.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The final game featured controller and keyboard support.</li>
									<li>We implemented basic controls, block, light attack, heavy attack as well as unique combo mechanics, such as a feint and dash attack.</li>
									<li>Semi procedural animations were used to help sell the "impact" of a hit, making the gloves feel dynamic and responsive to collisions.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Development</h2>
								<p>My role in this project was primarily as a programmer focusing on gameplay mechanics, however I also explored shader graph, vfx and animations. I implemented the attack patterns, player movement and camera systems.</p>
								<p>Given the time constraints we had to make comprimises on the overall depth of the game, so I attempted to make what we had as polished as possible, both mechanically and visually. I created shaders for the characters, as well as particle effects for the attacks. For the animations I focused on creating responsive movements, ensuring that we detected collisions with the opponent, applying damage and knockback. As mentioned we also implemented controller support, which allowed for haptic feedback to further enhance the gameplay and feel of the project.</p>

								<h2></h2>
								<p>Ultimately the game was submitted for the game jam in a relatively developed and fun to play state. It recieved positive feedback, and we recieved some push to develop an online multiplayer mode, which was originaly planned, but with the change in direction for our final year project we decided to put this on hold.</p>
