								<h2>About the Project</h2>
								<p>This mod was developed for a second year uni project, the mod involved adding a new puzzle mechanic and adding to the existing train system in Half Life. This mod involved creating a level using Jack Hammer, working in the GoldSrc engine and directly modifying Half Life 1s source code.</p>
								<p>The core idea was to extend Half Life’s rail sequences with a fuel-gated progression loop. Players must restore power to a train by sourcing fuel, routing pipes and interacting with valves in order to depart. The work combined level scripting in the J.A.C.K. editor along side engine-side changes compiled into custom DLLs.</p>

								<h2>Goals and Features</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>The primary goal was to create a 5 minute level that introduces the puzzle mechanic in a way that would feel seamless within the existing gameplay.</li>
									<li>The puzzle loop was a Fuel-gated train system integrated with existing GoldSrc path_track and func_train logic.</li>
									<li>There was a secondary focus on diegetic and environmental signage for guidance, allowing me to experience Level Design from a developer's perspective.</li>
								</ul>
							</section>

								<h2>Technical Work</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>GoldSrc Engine (Half-Life 1) — Custom C/C++ changes built into client/server DLLs.</li>
									<li>Level design using J.A.C.K. editor — Entity I/O wiring, optimisation and light pass. The level features scripted events using Half Life's built in entity system.</li>
									<li>Gameplay - State machine for train power, interacting with fuel sources and classic Half-Life mechanics like enemies, puzzles and environmental storytelling.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>On the code side I introduced a series of additions. Starting with tracking the fuel state of the train and introducing a system for managing pipe interactions. The train uses the built in func_train entity to move along a path, meaning my system could be implemented into the base game easily.</p>
							</section>

								<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>The technical limitations of the GoldSrc engine and J.A.C.K editor meant I had to get creative with the mechanics set-up. A lack of built-in support for certain interactions, such as pipe rotations, required a lot of custom scripting and workarounds. Coming up with a method to chain pipes together, allowing the game to know when the puzzle was solved, was a key challenge.</li>
									<li>Implementing save and load logic with the puzzle mechanics was also challenging as I had to ensure the state of the train and the pipe puzzles persisted correctly using a system I was not familiar with.</li>
									<li>The most significant challenge and point of failure was working with the limited debugging tools available, meaning I had to work around the lack of real-time feedback and logging. It proved an interesting challenge that required a lot of trial and error.</li>
								</ul>
